This web page was the second project of the Ruby on Rails programming language of the Microverse curriculum.
In this project, I learned the importance of forms applications and MVCs in developing real-world solutions.

## Getting Started

This project was created to study the importance of developing form application solutions, MVCs and their application in Ruby on Rails.

### Prerequisites

Computer running [Mac OS](https://www.apple.com/macos/big-sur/), [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10), or [Linux Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download). [Ruby V.3.0.0](https://www.ruby-lang.org/es/downloads/)...

### Install

Getting Started
To get a locusing [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), first, you must [install it by following these steps](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs), then you must [open the folder containing my repository in your local repository](https://thisdavej.com/right-click-on-windows-folder-and-open-with-visual-studio-code/#:~:text=You%20can%20now%20navigate%20to,with%20VS%20Code%E2%80%9D%20as%20well.) and [open each of the files](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved) to see their content.

- To run the program, firstly, you will have to open a terminal in the repository download path, after that, it will run, change the path of your terminal by typing `cd bin` and press the Enter key, after that it will execute the `rails server` command, This will be able to run the program and will generate a file called "articles_list.csv" in the folder "bin" with the results of the execution.
- Web scraping or web scraping is a technique used by software programs to extract information from websites.1 Usually, these programs simulate the navigation of a human on the World Wide Web either by using the HTTP protocol manually, or by embedding a browser in an app.
- If you want to do coding tests to this repository you can do it with [RSpec] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSpec), first you must open your terminal in the path where you downloaded the repository, then it will execute the code `gem install rspec`, once the installation is finished we will proceed to verify the version of RSpec through the command in the terminal` rspec --version`, once the version is verified we will proceed to execute the command `rspec --init` To start RSpec in your local repository, once these steps are completed, you will only have to execute the command `rspec` to run the tests in this repository, it should be noted that these tests are very useful to see the correct operation of the application.
- If you have any questions or problems about how to run this project, you can leave me a comment in the [issues section](https://github.com/aristides1000/rails-forms/issues) of this repository, I am more than willing to help you.

### Usage

Run the command `rails server` with [Ruby V.3.0.1](https://www.ruby-lang.org/es/downloads/).

### Run tests

Linters errors
